# mars-probe-simulation
I needed a simulation that's also open source, so I made it.

For now, it's a Jupyter notebook. If you're a teacher unaware of how Jupyter notebooks work, they're basically rich text files, where you can weave code through textual information and pictures. By far, it is the easiest way to make hands-on code practice. You have two options: use Jupyter Lite at https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/ or you can try Colab. Jupyter Lite doesn't require a login, but it's not tablet or phone friendly and every student needs to sit at a computer. Google Colab makes the notebook easier to distribute, but (even though it's made by Google) it's considered an external application and you have to have it explicitly allowed by your administrator beforehand. In case you go the Colab way, do not be deterred by its shaking of fists about the limited amount of calculation you get: it's about 80 hours at the time of writing (June 2024), and given that each run-through of the notebook takes less than 2 seconds, you should be fine. Or you can install Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook locally on your school computers, but that seems like an overkill unless you plan to use that tool on a regular basis.

The webapp is in development, hidden in the mars_probe directory. There's some error handling to be had. But you can check out the code if you want.
